# State City Wikipedia Scraper
This will be a python script that will scrape wikipedia to get a list of cities for each state to be used for whatever you want to use it for. I was looking around online to see if there were any lists like this that existed and it didn't seem that was the case (unless I missed it lol). Most that existed were just state list OR city list, no combinations of states paired with their respective cities. For the software I'm currently writing, I wanted users to be able to pick very specifically so I figured scraping the data from the list of cities / towns / municipalities provided by Wikipedia would do the trick.

I don't think you'll actually have to do anything unless the script needs to be updated but the output should be somewhere for your use.

Was able to get everything so far except for DC. This script gets more than just cities but also all of the towns / municipalities / etc for the particular state. I think this works for my use case since ideally for my software I'd like users to have as many location options as possible without just limiting to cities only etc.
