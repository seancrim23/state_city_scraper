# State City Wikipedia Scraper
This is a python script that scrapes Wikipedia using the Beautiful Soup Python library to get a list of cities for each state to be used for whatever you want to use it for. 

I was looking around online to see if there were any lists like this that existed and it didn't seem that was the case (unless I missed it lol). Most that existed were just state list OR city list, no combinations of states paired with their respective cities. For the software I'm currently writing, I wanted users to be able to pick very specifically so I figured scraping the data from the list of cities / towns / municipalities provided by Wikipedia would do the trick.

I don't think you'll actually have to do anything unless the script needs to be updated but the output should be somewhere for your use.

This was also a great crash course in the Beautiful Soup library which I'm definitely going to use more in the future: [Beautiful Soup Docs](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### To Do:
I don't really see a pressing need at the moment to complete any of these to do's but figured I'd add them if I want to take a crack at them in the future.
```
- Code could possibly be cleaned up (dynamically build the Soup search based on the state instead of 15 different code blocks)
- Filter option to only return cities / towns / municipalities
```
