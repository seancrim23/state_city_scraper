# state_city_scraper
This will be a python script that will scrape wikipedia to get a list of cities for each state to be used for whatever you want to use it for.

I don't think you'll actually have to do anything unless the script needs to be updated but the output should be somewhere for your use.

Was able to get everything so far except for DC. This script gets more than just cities but also all of the towns / municipalities / etc for the particular state. I think this works for my use case since ideally for my software I'd like users to have as many location options as possible without just limiting to cities only etc.
